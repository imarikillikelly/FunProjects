🎉 **FunProjects**

 Welcome to FunProjects — my playground for all things data analysis, visualization, scripting, and programming. This repo is my public portfolio, where I showcase hands-on projects that highlight both my technical chops and my curiosity for solving real-world problems with data.

 Each branch in this repo is dedicated to a different project — so think of it like browsing through different “episodes” in an ongoing series.
 Enjoy! 🍿
